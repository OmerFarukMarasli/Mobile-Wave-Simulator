# Mobile-Wave-Simulator

Physics Wave Simulator - Mobile Wave Simulation
Physics Wave Simulator is an interactive simulation application that allows you to create and observe waves on mobile devices. Designed to make learning physics easier and more engaging, the app enables real-time visualization of wave movements by adjusting key parameters.

### Features
1. **Wavelength Adjustment**: Experiment with different wavelengths and observe how they affect wave motion.  
2. **Amplitude Control**: Modify the amplitude to change the intensity and height of the waves.  
3. **Frequency Adjustment**: Control the wave speed by increasing or decreasing its frequency.  
4. **Real-Time Visualization**: Instantly see the effects of your adjustments on the waves.  
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI for understanding physics concepts effortlessly.
